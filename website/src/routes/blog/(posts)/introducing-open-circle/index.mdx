A few months ago, we moved the Valibot and Formisch repositories from Fabian's personal GitHub account into the Open Circle organization. This post explains what Open Circle is, why we made this change, and what this means for you and the projects going forward.

## TL;DR

- Valibot and Formisch now live under the Open Circle GitHub organization
- Nothing changes except the repository URL.
- Sponsorships are now handled transparently through Open Collective

## What is Open Circle?

 [Open Circle](https://github.com/open-circle) is a GitHub organization that serves as the shared home for Valibot, Formisch, and future projects that share our philosophy around modularity, type safety, and developer experience. Think of the organization as a container for related projects. It is not a tool or library you install.

## Why Open Circle?

### Access control

As Valibot and Formisch grew, more people wanted to help maintain them, but personal GitHub accounts only allowed full access or bottlenecks through a single maintainer. With Open Circle, we can grant different levels of control to team members without giving any single person full control.

### Sponsorships

Before, sponsorships went directly to a personal account. Now they flow through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/valibot), which provides complete transparency. Every donation and expense is visible to everyone. This builds trust with sponsors because they can see exactly where their money goes. It also makes it possible to fairly compensate contributors for their work. Open source maintainers deserve to be paid for the value they create, and a transparent financial structure makes that possible and sustainable long term.

### Unified ecosystem

We moved projects like Valibot and Formisch under Open Circle so related projects can be maintained together. Related tools, documentation, and resources are now easier to find for anyone building or maintaining systems with the same design principles.

## What's Changed?

The main change is the repository URL.

## What This Means for the Future

- An expanded core team with formalized roles and shared decision-making
- Better compensation and recognition for contributor work
- Shared resources and tooling across projects
- A proper home for future projects aligned with our philosophy
- Clearer contribution guidelines and standards that help new maintainers get up to speed faster

## Thank you

This move would not be possible without the community around Valibot and Formisch. Contributors, users, and companies running these projects in production have all shaped how these projects have evolved and what they require now structurally.

Thanks as well to everyone who has sponsored the work. Your support makes it possible to invest in maintenance decisions that prioritize long term stability over convenience decisions that benefit these projects.
